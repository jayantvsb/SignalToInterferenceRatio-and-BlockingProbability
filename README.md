# SignalToInterferenceRatio-and-BlockingProbability

plotting the cumulative distribution function of the signal-to-total-interference ratio in case of cellular systems with frequency reuse factor of 3 and 7 and with sectoring (120 degree)
And calculating blocking probability as the fractions of users getting blocked if there is no available channel for the case of reuse factor 1
